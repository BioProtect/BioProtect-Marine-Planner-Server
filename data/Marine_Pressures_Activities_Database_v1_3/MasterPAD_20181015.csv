The ex-military vessels had been submerged for 3 to 17 years.

Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull causing collision injury or death. In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involve collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120; 4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075].

Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4378; 2826]. Bird collisions with vessels, including fishing vessels [2826], have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels.

Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160; 3096], surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160; 3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3160; 2752; 5123; JNCC0278; JNCC0239]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [JNCC0239].

Underwater explosions are one of the strongest point sources of anthropogenic sound in the seas. Sound from explosives can also travel tremendous distances [4869]. Underwater transmission of explosions is complex with an initial shock pulse followed by a succession of oscillating bubble pulses. Source levels vary with the type and amount of explosives used, the water depth at which the explosion occurs and can range from 272 to 287 dB re 1 µPa zero to peak at 1 m distance (1 - 100 lb. TNT) [4921]. Military artillery produce noise levels in excess of 180dB and the firing of live ordinance produces broadband frequencies at a source level in excess of 270dB. Sounds of 270db could cause auditory damage to cetaceans at distances of several kilometres from the sound source and could cause disturbance to cetaceans at a distance of tens of kilometres. There is a range of possible military equipment that could be used in training exercises in the UK including; military jets, submarines, warships (including minesweepers and sub-hunters), landing craft, power boats and sonobuoys are utilised during these exercises. Many of the exercises involve the use of active sonar which would be capable of generating noise at a range of frequencies from 0.25 - 200 kHz and a range of volumes up to 230+ dB [5077]. Additionally, vessel movements are an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater.

Underwater explosions are one of the strongest point sources of anthropogenic sound in the seas. Sound from explosives can also travel tremendous distances [4869]. Underwater transmission of explosions is complex with an initial shock pulse followed by a succession of oscillating bubble pulses. Source levels vary with the type and amount of explosives used, the water depth at which the explosion occurs and can range from 272 to 287 dB re 1 µPa zero to peak at 1 m distance (1 - 100 lb. TNT) [4921]. Military artillery produce noise levels in excess of 180dB and the firing of live ordinance produces broadband frequencies at a source level in excess of 270dB. Sounds of 270db could cause auditory damage to cetaceans at distances of several kilometres from the sound source and could cause disturbance to cetaceans at a distance of tens of kilometres. There is a range of possible military equipment that could be used in training exercises in the UK including; military jets, submarines, warships (including minesweepers and sub-hunters), landing craft, power boats and sonobuoys are utilised during these exercises. Many of the exercises involve the use of active sonar which would be capable of generating noise at a range of frequencies from 0.25 - 200 kHz and a range of volumes up to 230+ dB [5077].

Source levels vary with the type and amount of explosives used, the water depth at which the explosion occurs and can range from 272 to 287 dB re 1 µPa zero to peak at 1 m distance (1 - 100 lb. TNT) [4921]. Military artillery produce noise levels in excess of 180dB and the firing of live ordinance produces broadband frequencies at a source level in excess of 270dB. Sounds of 270db could cause auditory damage to cetaceans at distances of several kilometres from the sound source and could cause disturbance to cetaceans at a distance of tens of kilometres. There is a range of possible military equipment that could be used in training exercises in the UK including; military jets, submarines, warships (including minesweepers and sub-hunters), landing craft, power boats and sonobuoys are utilised during these exercises. Many of the exercises involve the use of active sonar which would be capable of generating noise at a range of frequencies from 0.25 - 200 kHz and a range of volumes up to 230+ dB [5077].

The majority of these rigs have three or four legs, with each leg terminating in a spudcan of up to 20 m diameter. Seabed disturbance associated with jack-up rigs is considered likely within a radius of 500 m (taking into account of any additional rig stabilisation (rock dump) footprint. In deeper waters, semi-submersible rigs may be used. These typically use between 8 and 12 anchors to hold position, the radius of which depends on the water depth, seabed conditions and anticipated metocean conditions. The depth of sediment over-turned by anchor-scarring would be of the order of several metres and exposed sediments are likely to be similar to existing surficial sediments [JNCC0299; JNCC0300].
Some offshore structures consist of a tubular framework (or jacket). Piles driven into the seafloor secure the jacket. Driving of piles for these structures will cause localised physical disturbance around the piles. 
The surface hole sections of exploration wells are typically drilled riserless, producing a localised (and transient) pile of surface-hole cuttings around the surface conductor. The persistence of cuttings discharged at the seabed is largely determined by the potential for it to be redistributed by tidal and other currents. After installation of the surface casing, the blowout preventer (BOP) is positioned on the wellhead housing. These operations (and associated activities such as ROV operations) may result in physical disturbance of the immediate vicinity (a few metres) of the wellhead [JNCC0299; JNCC0300].
The laying of pipelines, umbilicals and cables associated with the oil and gas industry can also cause localised physical disturbance.

Exploratory drilling can also increase suspended sediments though the discharge and subsequent dispersion of drill cuttings. Dispersion of mud and cuttings is influenced by various factors, including particle size distribution and density, vertical and horizontal turbulence, current flows and water depth. In deep water, the range of cuttings particle size results in a significant variation in settling velocity, and a consequent gradient in the size distribution of settled cuttings, with coarser material close to the discharge location and finer material very widely dispersed away from the location, generally at undetectable loading. [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305]. The dragging of anchors and scouring caused by moorings can cause localised and temporary increases in suspended sediments [3223].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120; 4987; JNCC0300]. Collision with underwater infrastructure associated with the oil and gas industry is considered unlikely given the lack of exposed rotating (or rapidly moving) underwater machinery. However, a lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075].

Water-based mud cuttings are discharged at, or relatively close to sea surface during “closed drilling” (i.e. when steel casing and a riser is in place), whereas surface hole cuttings will be discharged at seabed during “open-hole” drilling. Use of oil based mud systems, for example in highly deviated sections or in water reactive shale sections, would require the onshore disposal or reinjection of the waste material.

Includes those priority substances listed in Annex II of Directive 2008/105/EC.,"Throughout the drilling process, drilling fluid known as ‘drilling muds’ is used in drilling engineering. Water-based drilling muds are comprised of a selection of (non-toxic) chemicals, seawater and weighting agents (which are commonly finely ground dense minerals such as barite or ilmenite). 
The past, discharge to sea of drill cuttings contaminated with oil based drill mud resulted in well documented acute and chronic effects at the seabed. These effects resulted from the interplay of a variety of factors of which direct toxicity (when diesel based muds were used) or secondary toxicity as a consequence of organic enrichment (from hydrogen sulphide produced by bacteria under anaerobic conditions) were probably the most important. However, the use of the discharge of oil based material in the marine environment is banned under European legislation [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305].

Lighted vessels and structures (such as jack-up platforms) involved in oil and gas construction may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light from vessels may also be of concern where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [3083; 3088; 3195; 2797; 3107; 4334; 4339; JNCC302; JNCC0299; JNCC0301]. An assessment of the scale of impact of lighting from offshore oil structures in United Kingdom waters concluded that under certain weather conditions large numbers of birds can occasionally be attracted to offshore platforms. However, relatively few species were attracted in sizable numbers and those that were had large and stable breeding populations thus indicating that no significant environmental impact was occurring [5004].

243,Energy generation,Oil and gas infrastructure: Construction (see also piling and pipelines),"Introduction of other substances (solid, liquid or gas)","Throughout the drilling process, drilling fluid known as ‘drilling muds’ is used in drilling engineering. Water-based drilling muds are comprised of a selection of (non-toxic) chemicals, seawater and weighting agents (which are commonly finely ground dense minerals such as barite or ilmenite). 
In the past, discharge to sea of drill cuttings contaminated with oil based drill mud resulted in well documented acute and chronic effects at the seabed. These effects resulted from the interplay of a variety of factors of which direct toxicity (when diesel based muds were used) or secondary toxicity as a consequence of organic enrichment (from hydrogen sulphide produced by bacteria under anaerobic conditions) were probably the most important. However, the use of the discharge of oil based material in the marine environment is banned under European legislation [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305].
This pressure also relates to vessels associated with this activity and their movement. The primary chemicals of environmental concern in vessel oil and fuel are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) [4985]. Deliberate discharges of oil or oil/water mixtures from ships are prohibited within the North West European Waters Special Area, established by the International Maritime Organization under MARPOL Annex I in 1999. This includes all waters around the UK and its approaches. However, accidental discharges still occur. Information on accidental discharges of oil from ships and offshore platforms is compiled by the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency each year. Although the majority of incidents are minor, several incidents occur annually that have led to the actual or potential release of significant amounts of oil (typically from large shipping vessels and tankers). At least 23 confirmed discharges were attributed to vessel casualties including 13 pleasure craft and workboats, 8 fishing vessels, a general cargo vessel and a tug.  The largest vessel-casualty spill was seven tonnes and was due to a cargo vessel. Vessel casualties accounted for 54% of all confirmed discharges attributed to pleasure craft and workboats [4968; 4915].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).",The associated evidence follows JNCC's evidence quality assurance policy (2014).

Offshore oil and gas platforms are among the largest artificial structures in the marine environment [JNCC0303].
Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur. All vessels have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978; 5177]. 
Marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water [3164]. There is concern that the expansion of non-indigenous species could alter local biodiversity and sometimes compete with native species, some of which are of commercial interest. This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The oil and gas industry provides direct and indirect pathways for alien invasive species, through vessel movements and structures [5000].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

The majority of these rigs have three or four legs, with each leg terminating in a spudcan of up to 20m diameter. Seabed disturbance associated with jack-up rigs is considered likely within a radius of 500m (taking into account of any additional rig stabilisation (rock dump) footprint. In deeper waters, semi-submersible rigs may be used. These typically use between 8 and 12 anchors to hold position, the radius of which depends on the water depth, seabed conditions and anticipated metocean conditions.  The depth of sediment over-turned by anchor-scarring would be of the order of several metres and exposed sediments are likely to be similar to existing surficial sediments [JNCC0299; JNCC0300].
Some offshore structures consist of a tubular framework (or jacket). Piles driven into the seafloor secure the jacket. Driving of piles for these structures will cause localised physical disturbance around the piles. 
The surface hole sections of exploration wells are typically drilled riserless, producing a localised (and transient) pile of surface-hole cuttings around the surface conductor. The persistence of cuttings discharged at the seabed is largely determined by the potential for it to be redistributed by tidal and other currents. After installation of the surface casing, the blowout preventer (BOP) is positioned on the wellhead housing. These operations (and associated activities such as ROV operations) may result in physical disturbance of the immediate vicinity (a few metres) of the wellhead [JNCC0299; JNCC0300].
The laying of pipelines, umbilicals and cables associated with the oil and gas industry can also cause localised physical disturbance. The footprint of disturbance is dependent on whether it is buried or not and the hydrology and sediment dynamics in the locality [JNCC0299].",medium-high,,The associated evidence follows JNCC's evidence quality assurance policy (2014).

Scour protection in the form of gravel, rocks, sandbags, gabions, pre-formed concrete blocks or frond mats is routinely used for subsea structures and for pipelines to prevent free-spanning [3122; 3127; 3083; 3125; JNCC0299]. Piles can change the seabed type within the footprint of the piling works from soft sediment to an artificial substratum (typically steel) [4898; 4908; 4890; 4892].

In contrast to historic oil based mud discharges, potential smothering effects due to the discharge of cuttings drilled with water based muds (WBM) are usually subtle or undetectable, although the presence of drilling material at the seabed is often detectable close to the drilling location (<500m). Modelling of WBM cutting discharges has indicated that deposition of material is generally thin and quickly reduces away from the well. However, the discharge of drill cuttings and water-based fluids may cause some smothering in the direct near vicinity of the well location. Localised siltation can also occur as a result of the remobilisation (and subsequent deposition) of sediment on the seabed due to the placement of structures (such as drilling rigs, jack-up platforms, spudcans, gravity bases and pipelines) and any dredging required during construction  [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305; 5004].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

252,Energy generation,Oil and gas infrastructure: Construction (see also piling and pipelines),Underwater noise changes,"Available measurements indicate that drilling activities produce mainly low-frequency continuous noise from several separate sources on the drilling unit. The primary sources of noise are various types of rotating machinery but the overall acoustic output depends on the type of operation. When drilling from semi-submersible rigs, noise is transmitted from the rig to the water column through submerged parts of the drilling unit hull, risers and mooring cables. If position is maintained by dynamic positioning, noise from thrusters may dominate the lower frequency band. Noise transmission from jack-up drilling units used in shallower water is less because of reduced surface area contact between the water column and submerged parts of the rig. Sound pressure levels  in the range of approximately 120dB re 1µPa in the frequency range 2-1400Hz is considered typical of drilling from a jack-up rig. Drilling duration may range from a few weeks for an exploration well, to several years in the case of a large development programme [JNCC0299; JNCC0304; 5004].
The overall source levels resulting from pipe laying operations are not typically measured. Noise levels are likely be dominated by the vessel noise associated with the installation. A pipeline installation which includes trenching and backfilling activities, is likely to be comparable to dredging activities [JNCC0299; JNCC0304; 5004].
Most vessels involved in the oil and gas industry are medium-size ships (50-100m length) which produce broadband source levels within the 165-180 dB re 1 µPa range and although there is considerable variability in associated frequency spectra, they tend to be similar to large vessels with dominant frequency below 1kHz) [JNCC0299]. 
Piling is required to fix subsea structures into the seabed such as manifolds and platform legs. The size of piles required are dependent upon a number of factors including the size of the structure to be installed and seabed conditions. Available source levels range from 210 dB (0-peak) re 1µPa @1m (for a 0.75 m pile) to 257 dB (0-peak) re 1µPa @1m (for a 4.2 m pile). 
Dredging is required to remove or alter areas of the seabed that are not optimal for infrastructure installation, for example, it may be necessary to remove large sand waves and flatten the seabed prior to pipelay activities [JNCC0304].

In some cases, individual scour pits coalescing to form a depression (referred to as “ global scour”) can occur over a much bigger area, of the same order as the area of the structure supported by the piles [JNCC0299].
Vessel anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery. Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide. The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971]. There is a tendency for the anchor to penetrate to deep depths in softer sediment as the opening of the anchor flukes prevents deep penetration in harder sediment [5076].

Drilling can also increase suspended sediments though the discharge and subsequent dispersion of drill cuttings. Dispersion of mud and cuttings is influenced by various factors, including particle size distribution and density, vertical and horizontal turbulence, current flows and water depth. In deep water, the range of cuttings particle size results in a significant variation in settling velocity, and a consequent gradient in the size distribution of settled cuttings, with coarser material close to the discharge location and finer material very widely dispersed away from the location, generally at undetectable loading [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305].

Mortality can occur directly with oil and gas infrastructure or through overexposure to heat from or incineration in flare stacks [JNCC0301]. Population level effects of direct platform mortality may be region and species specific depending on the numbers of platforms in operation and the species that encounter them during migration. For example, at a research platform in the North Sea a total of 442 birds of 21 species were found dead (the platform has no rotating turbine blades, but has a metmast and navigation lights) between October 2003 and December 2004. Over half of the strikes occurred on just two nights characterised by periods of very poor visibility with mist or drizzle and presumably increased attraction of the illuminated research platform [JNCC0301].

Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120; 4987; JNCC0300]. Collision with underwater infrastructure associated with the oil and gas industry is considered unlikely given the lack of exposed rotating (or rapidly moving) underwater machinery. However, a lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075].

The past, discharge to sea of drill cuttings contaminated with oil based drill mud resulted in well documented acute and chronic effects at the seabed.

Offshore oil and gas platforms are among the largest artificial structures in the marine environment [JNCC0303].
Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur. All vessels have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978; 5177]. 
Marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water [3164]. There is concern that the expansion of non-indigenous species could alter local biodiversity and sometimes compete with native species, some of which are of commercial interest. This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The oil and gas industry provides direct and indirect pathways for alien invasive species, through vessel movements and structures [5000].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

For example, gas platform jacket leg scour of depths of 1.5 to 3.5 m was recorded in the southern North Sea. In some cases, individual scour pits coalescing to form a depression (referred to as “ global scour”) can occur over a much bigger area, of the same order as the area of the structure supported by the piles [JNCC0299].
Vessel anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery. Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide. The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971]. There is a tendency for the anchor to penetrate to deep depths in softer sediment as the opening of the anchor flukes prevents deep penetration in harder sediment [5076].

In contrast to historic oil based mud discharges, potential smothering effects due to the discharge of cuttings drilled with water based muds (WBM) are usually subtle or undetectable, although the presence of drilling material at the seabed is often detectable close to the drilling location (<500m). Modelling of WBM cutting discharges has indicated that deposition of material is generally thin and quickly reduces away from the well. However, the discharge of drill cuttings and water-based fluids may cause some smothering in the direct near vicinity of the well location. Localised siltation can also occur as a result of the remobilisation (and subsequent deposition) of sediment on the seabed due to scour around structures (such as drilling rigs, jack-up platforms, spudcans, gravity bases, pipelines and anchors) and any dredging required during maintenance  [JNCC0299; JNCC0300; JNCC0305; 5004].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

274,Energy generation,Oil and gas infrastructure: Operation and maintenance,Underwater noise changes,"Available measurements indicate that drilling activities produce mainly low-frequency continuous noise from several separate sources on the drilling unit. The primary sources of noise are various types of rotating machinery but the overall acoustic output depends on the type of operation. When drilling from semi-submersible rigs, noise is transmitted from the rig to the water column through submerged parts of the drilling unit hull, risers and mooring cables. If position is maintained by dynamic positioning, noise from thrusters may dominate the lower frequency band. Noise transmission from jack-up drilling units used in shallower water is less because of reduced surface area contact between the water column and submerged parts of the rig. Sound pressure levels  in the range of approximately 120dB re 1µPa in the frequency range 2-1400Hz is considered typical of drilling from a jack-up rig. Drilling duration may range from a few weeks for an exploration well, to several years in the case of a large development programme [JNCC0299; JNCC0304; 5004]. Most vessels involved in the oil and gas industry are medium-size ships (50-100m length) which produce broadband source levels within the 165-180 dB re 1 µPa range and although there is considerable variability in associated frequency spectra, they tend to be similar to large vessels with dominant frequency below 1kHz) [JNCC0299].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Oil released during a spill will contaminate the surface of the water, water column and seafloor as well as having an immediate impact on wildlife such as seabirds, benthic communities, marine mammals, [JNCC0203; JNCC0280; JNCC0219]. Depending on the type of spill, extent, location and environmental condition there can be varying long term impacts [JNCC0214; JNCC0236; JNCC0219].
Chemicals are also used in oil spill response and remediation. Oil dispersants are a class of chemicals used to break up surface oil slicks can lead to reduced oiling of beaches and shorelines. Oil dispersants are typically solutions containing one or more surfactants. In addition, chemical surface washing agents are also used to promote oil removal from substrates [JNCC0316; JNCC0317].",medium-high,,The associated evidence follows JNCC's evidence quality assurance policy (2014).

Bird collisions with vessels, including fishing vessels [2826], have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals but also fish and seabirds). Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull causing collision injury or death. In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120; 4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075].

338,Waste management activities,Sewage disposal,Litter,"Litter can enter the marine environment as sewage related debris from treated and untreated  sewage discharged to estuarine and marine waters [JNCC0287]. Micro plastics are also  found in discharges. Although low concentrations of microplastics are generally found in sewage discharges, outfalls have the potential to act as a pathway to release microplastics given the large volumes of effluent discharged to the aquatic environment [JNCC0306]. In addition, the construction and maintenance phase of an outfall may require a number of vessels and vehicles in the marine environment which could cause litter. Some discharges may contain floating waste [3126; 3139; 4401]. Marine litter can be released into the marine environment by shipping vessels, either accidentally (inappropriate storage) or deliberately [4974; 3160]. Shipping litter includes pallets, strapping bans and drums. Cargo may also be washed overboard during stormy weather and contribute to coastal litter levels. Shipping related litter contributes approximately 2 % of the litter found on UK beaches. Shipping related litter contributed approximately 45 litter items per kilometre around the UK on average between 2003 and 2007 [4915; 3160].

Nutrient enrichment can lead to increases in the abundance and biomass of certain benthic and phytoplankton species, which in turn can increase production of higher trophic levels (e.g. fish). It can also lead to an increase in opportunistic macroalgae and excessive nutrient enrichment can result in anoxia, and consequently, to declines in biomass and diversity in the benthic and fish community [JNCC0242]. Seagrass beds are also particularly vulnerable to damage from nutrient over-enrichment [JNCC0307]. Nutrient over-enrichment of coastal waters can also lead to harmful algal blooms [JNCC0307]. This pressure can also result during any excavation/dredging works involved in the construction of outfall pipes [3161; 3164]. The mobilisation of sediment will result in an increase in suspended sediments and the release of organic matter and nutrients  [3145; 5121]; however, the effect is usually highly restricted in time and space [4899].

This requires the movement of heavy machinery and vehicles across the surface of the seabed or coastal habitat and potentially also excavation/dredging works which can lead to abrasion/disturbance [3139; 4403; JNCC0332]. During construction and maintenance, vessel anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery.  The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971]. There is a tendency for the anchor to penetrate to deep depths in softer sediment as the opening of the anchor flukes prevents deep penetration in harder sediment [5076].

Further, abrasion is associated with the movement of people ('trampling') or indeed any vehicles used for access or participation in the harvesting activity (e.g. tractors or JCBs), and can result in damage to infauna and epifauna as well as sensitive habitats such as seagrass [1419; 1436; 4480; JNCC0345; JNCC0346]. Where vessels are used to provide access, the pressure is likely to be associated with any anchors, which can cause damage to the seabed surface and subsurface layers upon deployment/recovery and due to dragging [4971], or the vessel (including e.g. the propeller/wash) itself may cause abrasion if it comes into contact with the seabed in shallow water. Mechanised harvesting of seaweeds (namely trawling/sledging/dredging) operate in areas of rocky substrate and therefore differ from other forms of dredging (e.g. scallop dredging) that physically disturb the underlying substrate [JNCC0345].

Vessel movement is an important source of underwater noise, with noise emitted typically varying with vessel size whereby larger vessels generate lower frequency sound. Although propeller cavitation is the main source of such noise, gear operation and turbulence around the hull will also result in noise being transmitted underwater by vessels [3152; 3096; 4921]. For example, the source levels associated with small sea going vessels are typically 160-180 dB re 1 µPa-m (RMS) [3152].

The noise and turbidity arising from dredging operations, which may be required during pipeline construction, may pose a barrier to migration when occurring on or in proximity of specific migratory routes [3152; 3080; 2757]. The scale of the impact will depend on the scale of the activity and the location and will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine relevance to a given feature/site. Onshore thermal discharges that cross the foreshore have the potential to displace longshore-migrating fish or other biota into deeper water (sometimes known as the ""travelator effect"") [JNCC0322].

Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4378; 2826]. Bird collisions with vessels, including fishing vessels [2826], have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels. Nocturnal bird strikes on vessels tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel [4466; 4378; 4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals but also fish and seabirds). Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull causing collision injury or death. In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120; 4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

453,Waste management activities,Power station thermal and nuclear discharges,Deoxygenation,"Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in waters receiving a thermal discharge can be reduced in two ways; firstly, the solubility of oxygen in seawater depends primarily on salinity and temperature so raising the temperature will lower the oxygen solubility; however, this will only affect the DO level when the ambient level is at or close to saturation and secondly, the biological and chemical oxygen demand is accelerated at higher temperatures [JNCC0322]. These are most likely to be of concern in polluted waters, particularly in estuarine environments. The depletion of DO in thermal discharge zones of any UK nuclear plants has not been a notable concern in the past [JNCC0226]. The pressure is also associated with sediment mobilisation and increase of suspended sediments as well as the deposition of organic matter. The pressure can therefore result from outflow pipe construction during any excavation/dredging works as well as the outflow during operation [3161; 3164].

Lighting can affect marine species (namely birds and fish). Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4378; 2826].

472,Waste management activities,Power station thermal and nuclear discharges,Temperature increase,"Electric power plants require cooling water to complete the steam cycle. Low-energy steam from the turbines is condensed in large heat exchangers or condensers, with the condensed water being reused in the steam cycle. In directly cooled power stations this process of condensation uses large quantities of cooling water, with a nuclear power station of 1,600 MW generating capacity requiring c.70 m3 s-1. An increased temperature of the discharged water may affect the ecology of the surrounding area. In temperate regions, directly cooled coastal or estuarine power stations discharge cooling water typically between 8-12°C above the ambient water temperature into the receiving water body. The cooling water at discharge is unlikely to rise much above 30°C. The effluent, being warmer, is almost invariably less dense than the receiving environment (notwithstanding possible salinity differences) and thus tends to rise to the surface, with a persistent interface between these two water bodies maintained by this density difference, although the diffuser system will be designed to aid mixing. Heat is lost from the effluent plume predominantly by radiation to both air and water, but also, and increasingly as it cools, by mixing with the receiving water, this latter effect being of more significance in more turbulent waters. These factors tend to localize the area of potential environmental impact [JNCC0211]. When tidal flows are strong,
around the mid-flood and mid-ebb periods, the plume will be elongated and run parallel to the shoreline; at slack high and low water conditions, the plume will expand radially and develop greater width [JNCC0322]. In an estuarine channel this will cause it to occupy a greater proportion of the channel cross-section. The seabed immediately beneath the plume therefore receives little warming effect.",medium-high,,The associated evidence follows JNCC's evidence quality assurance policy (2014).

Titanium itself does not dissolve in seawater and presents no toxic risk. Other sources of heavy metals at large power stations relate principally to burning fossil fuels and scrubbing the resulting flue-gases, therefore are not associated with nuclear generation [JNCC0322]. Any use of copper elsewhere in the cooling system, for example in screenwell surface treatments or within intake screen materials (Cu/Ni alloy) would potentially give rise to copper within the discharge but dissolution rates are low.

The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959; 5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].

639,Extraction of living resources,Pelagic fishing (or fishing activities that do not interact with sea bed),Litter,"Marine litter is items made or used by people and deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost into the sea and on beaches. Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103]. Alongside existing legislation, potential mitigation measures are discussed in various sources of literature [2752],[3160],[5103].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

640,Extraction of living resources,Pelagic fishing (or fishing activities that do not interact with sea bed),Underwater noise changes,"Vessel movement is an important source of underwater noise, with noise emitted typically varying with vessel size whereby larger vessels generate lower frequency sound. Although propeller cavitation is the main source of such noise, gear deployment/towing/hauling, turbulence around the hull and the use of fish finding sonars will also result in noise being transmitted underwater by fishing vessels. For example, the source levels associated with small sea going vessels and echosounders are typically 160-180 dB and 235 (Peak) re 1µPa-m (RMS), respectively [3152]. Acoustic deterrents/harassing devices are an additional potential source of underwater noise  [3152],[3096],[4921]. Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, birds and mammals [3152],[4921],[2074],[3069],[3121],[4445],[4869]",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice  (see Activity-Pressure justification text).","The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Disturbance caused by light from vessels may also be of concern, particularly where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [3195],[4399].

The likelihood of impact will depend on factors such as the spatial/temporal scale of the activity and its location in relation to migratory routes, and so the pressure will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to a given feature/site. Whilst it is considered that examples of the association between this sub-activity and pressure will be rare, potential causes include fixed fishing gear in confined water bodies/estuaries, or behavioural effects from the use of acoustic deterrents [3121],[3152],[4921],[4445].

Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4399],[4378],[2826]. Bird collisions with vessels, including fishing vessels [4476],[2826], have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels.

Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].

Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34% of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103].

For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103].

Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103].

Construction activities associated with excavation and navigation dredging result in the physical removal of substrate and associated habitats and species resulting in a change in seabed type.  The degree of change will depend on the sensitivity and recoverability of the communities and frequency, duration and magnitude of activity.  Changes in seabed type can also arise from the alteration of the topography, hydrography, and sediment compositions associated resulting from these activities.  Alteration of hydrodynamic conditions as a result of capital dredge (or land reclaim) can change seabed sediment composition and distribution e.g. reduced current flow causing deposition of finer sediment and consequential change in benthic community. Capital dredging can also remove substrate to a depth that the underlying substrate is altered, thus result in a change in habitat and benthic community [2838],[3134],[3145],[3159],[4899],[4379],[4380].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.  Given the dynamic nature of many disposal sites, the water column is likely to be rapidly re-oxygenated, making any changes localised and very short-lived [3163],[2834],[4891].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6 m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

Similarly changing seabed/estuary profile due to the removal of substrate (capital dredging) or structures (decommissioning) will result in similar changes, causing localised changes to the hydrodynamic flow in an area.

892,Coastal Infrastructure,Anchorage and moorings: Construction,Underwater noise changes,"Ports construction and maintenance works and on-going operations can result in underwater noise, including from vessels, dredging, engineering works.  Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600 mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].  Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Fish farming generates large amounts of particulate organic waste products, and surrounding sediments are affected by this surplus of organic matter. The extent of impacts is determined from the quantity and quality of the input and environmental conditions at the location [4939]. Deposition of faeces and pseudo-faeces may lead to organic enrichment of seabed.  Nutrient waste may be generated through excretion by reared organisms or direct enrichment by or remineralisation of feed inputs. However, magnitude of pressure would depend on intensity/scale of activity and hydrographic conditions [2834],[3276],[3198],[4939]. Disposal of waste material into the marine environment includes the regulated discharge of wastewater and the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste [4915].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

In the case of tidal stream farms the operational noise from a small number of units may not exceed threshold levels, but the cumulative noise production from large numbers of units has the potential to mask the communication and echolocation sounds produced by aquatic organisms in the vicinity of the structures. Similar assumptions may apply to tidal range projects. Resolution of the significance or otherwise of noise impacts will require information about the energy generating device's acoustic signature (e.g., sound pressure levels across the full range of frequencies) for both individual units and multiple-unit arrays, similar characterization of ambient noise in the vicinity of the farm, the hearing sensitivity of fish and marine mammals that inhabit the area, and information about the behavioural responses to anthropogenic noise (e.g., avoidance, attraction, changes in schooling behaviour or migration routes) [ 5194].

927,Energy generation,Tidal lagoon/impoundment: Operation and maintenance,Barrier to species movement,"The pressure refers to obstructions to species movement caused by physical barrier or prolonged exposure to noise, light, visual disturbance or changes in water quality. The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. The presence of tidal energy projects can lead to a behavioural response (displacement from habitat and extension of flights/movement) for mobile species, effectively causing a barrier to movement [5162],[5166]. They may represent a barrier to movement of migrating or feeding animals and may potentially result in displacement of migration routes and displacement of feeding animals. Such displacements may incur heavier energetic costs, which may ultimately affect survival or breeding success  [3125]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990].

The degree of change will depend on the sensitivity and recoverability of the communities and frequency, duration and magnitude of activity.  Changes in seabed type can also arise from the alteration of the topography, hydrography, and sediment compositions associated resulting from these activities.  Alteration of hydrodynamic conditions as a result of capital dredge (or land reclaim) can change seabed sediment composition and distribution e.g. reduced current flow causing deposition of finer sediment and consequential change in benthic community.

During construction vessels may be used, if so species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull causing collision injury or death. In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].
A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

Ploughing, trenching, rock placement, and anchor placement will all result in abrasion and disturbance. Depending on the installation method used, the footprint of the seabed disturbed by telecommunication cable installation machinery could be between 5-10 m wide per cable trench for ploughing and trenching [4926],[4345]. Cables laid at the surface can result in some degree of abrasion mainly where there is high wave activity (in shallow waters of <20 m marks ranged from 6-45 cm wide) [4344]. Beyond this direct foot print, low intensity physical disturbance will also occur due to anchor handling inside the anchor corridor to a maximum of 1 km on each side of the cable. Anchors cause damage to the seabed upon engaging, dragging and embedding. The chain also causes abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery.

It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].

Piles used in coastal developments can be driven to depths of over -30 m Chart Datum, tubular piles are typically 1-2 m diameter, sheet piles typically 0.5-1 m wide and 0.1-0.2 m thick [4896],[4898],[4890].  Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1 m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6 m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6 m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

This sediment includes material disturbed at the drag head of the dredger and also some the overflow.  The relative elevation of suspended sediment above background levels will depend on dredge location, natural background level, type intensity, and duration of dredging, sediment characteristics.  The magnitude and spatial extent of the suspended sediment plume around dredging operations is a function of the type of dredge used, the physical and biological characteristics of the material being dredged (e.g., density, grain size, organic content) and site-specific hydrological conditions (e.g., currents, water body size/configuration).  A generalized ""worst case"" field can be defined as having suspended sediment levels less than or equal to 500 mg/L at distances less than or equal to 500 m from the dredge, with maximum concentrations generally restricted to the lower water column within 50-100 m, decreasing rapidly with distance [4899],[2838],[3082],[3106],[3159].  For example, the increase in suspended sediment concentrations as part of capital dredge project for a berth deepening in Southampton Water was predicted to be a few hundred mg/l above background levels immediately at the bucket/beneath the barge, with levels decreasing considerably within 100 m from the source and increases in suspended sediment concentrations between 10-20 mg/l expected along the plume [5078].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Construction and presence of structures in ports and harbours will cause a change in habitat type, typically from soft sediment to a hard substratum type; examples include steel piles used in berths/jetties, concrete and rock used in breakwaters/quays [4892],[4890].  Construction activities associated with excavation and navigation dredging result in the physical removal of substrate and associated habitats and species resulting in a change in seabed type.  The degree of change will depend on the sensitivity and recoverability of the communities and frequency, duration and magnitude of activity.  Changes in seabed type can also arise from the alteration of the topography, hydrography, and sediment compositions associated resulting from these activities.  Alteration of hydrodynamic conditions as a result of capital dredge (or land reclaim) can change seabed sediment composition and distribution e.g. reduced current flow causing deposition of finer sediment and consequential change in benthic community.

1180,Extraction (and disposal) of non-living resources,Capital dredging,Underwater noise changes,"Ports construction and maintenance works and on-going operations can result in underwater noise, including from vessels, dredging, engineering works.  Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1 µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1 µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increase noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[2834],[3152],[3273],[2707],[2825],[1533],[3136],[3145],[3169].  Coastal defences and structures can also result in barrier to species by restricting access to rivers/streams/estuaries or for species to adapt to sea level rise and coastal change [2817],[3096],[3154].

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].

Radionuclides from several categories may co-exist.  Estuarine and coastal sediments can contain elevated levels of radionuclides as a result of human activity and can reveal a history of local contamination [4483].  The London Convention (LC), modified in 1990s, bans the sea disposal of all radioactive wastes.  However further consideration was required due to ubiquitous nature of radioactivity (natural and artificial), as a strict interpretation of the LC would prohibited all disposal of any materials.  The International Atomic Energy Agency developed the concept of de minimis, for concentrations sufficiently low to allow their disposal; based on the principle, that protection of the human population would ensure adequate protection of non-human populations [4371].  The Environment Agency authorises discharges of radioactive waste to the environment in England, under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 [4372],[4373].  They have assessed the impact of these discharges on Natura 2000 sites [4373], involving the calculation of dose rates to organisms in coastal, freshwater and terrestrial environments.  The total dose rates were compared to a threshold of 40microgray/h, below which the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales agreed there would be no adverse effect to the integrity of a Natura 2000 sites.  The total dose rates are less than 40 microgray/h for all but two Natura 2000 sites (Ribble and Alt Estuaries SPA and Drigg Coast SAC).  The calculated total dose rate to the worst affected organism for the Ribble and Alt Estuaries SAC was 520 microgray/h, significantly in excess of the threshold.  A further assessment has been undertaken and new limits for industry on the Ribble implemented to ensure that the dose will be less than 40 microgray/h [4375].  The total dose rate for the Drigg Coast SAC is just greater than the 40 microgray/h threshold [4373].  Under the LC dredged material containing radioactivity at/below de minimis levels can be disposed of at sea; regulators require an assessment where compliance with de minimis levels has not been established or may be exceeded.  A 2006 review for dredging operations in England and Wales found that in most regions radionuclide concentrations fell well within de minimis criteria [4374].  Dredging operations in the Irish Sea included material that approached the de minimis criteria, these higher doses at ports such as Mayport on the Cumbrian coast, were due to a combination of artificial radionuclides released from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant (especially 137Cs, 241Am, Pu isotopes) and enhanced levels of naturally-occurring radionuclides resulting from non-nuclear industry (phosphate processing) near Whitehaven [4374],[4484],[4899],[4375].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

The mobilisation of sediment due to vessel movements, dredging, and disposal (including disposal associated with habitat creation) can increase levels of organic matter and nutrients [3145],[2838].  However, monitoring has shown that elevated nutrient and organic matter levels following most dredging campaigns are localised, temporal and maybe within natural variability [4899].  Disposal of wastes including regulated discharge of wastewater into the marine environment can result in nutrient enrichment [4915],[3185],[2293],[3096].

1193,Extraction (and disposal) of non-living resources,Capital dredging,Deoxygenation,"The pressure is associated with sediment mobilisation and increased of suspended sediments as well as the deposition of organic matter.  The pressure can result from a variety of ports and harbour activities including dredging, dredge disposal including alternative disposal and beneficial use of sediments , mobilisation of sediment due to vessel movements and construction activities [2834],[3096],[3153],[3161],[3163],[3106],[3159].  The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.

All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177].  Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water, these include bacteria and other microbes, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species.  It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].  Artificial structures in the marine environment e.g. breakwaters and jetties, have the potential to act as ‘stepping stones’ for the spread of non-native species.

Piles used in coastal developments can be driven to depths of over -30 m Chart Datum, tubular piles are typically 1-2 m diameter, sheet piles typically 0.5-1 m wide and 0.1-0.2 m thick [4896],[4898],[4890].  Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1 m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6 m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6 m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

1198,Extraction (and disposal) of non-living resources,Maintenance dredging,Changes in suspended solids (water clarity),"Dredging will cause local increases in suspended sediment, particularly in the direct vicinity of a dredge site. This sediment includes material disturbed at the drag head of the dredger and also some the overflow.  The relative elevation of suspended sediment above background levels will depend on dredge location, natural background level, type intensity, and duration of dredging, sediment characteristics.  The magnitude and spatial extent of the suspended sediment plume around dredging operations is a function of the type of dredge used, the physical and biological characteristics of the material being dredged (e.g., density, grain size, organic content) and site-specific hydrological conditions (e.g., currents, water body size/configuration).  A generalized ""worst case"" field can be defined as having suspended sediment levels less than or equal to 500 mg/L at distances less than or equal to 500 m from the dredge, with maximum concentrations generally restricted to the lower water column within 50-100 m, decreasing rapidly with distance [4899],[2838],[3082],[3106],[3159].  For example, the increase in suspended sediment concentrations as part of capital dredge project for a berth deepening in Southampton Water was predicted to be a few hundred mg/l above background levels immediately at the bucket/beneath the barge, with levels decreasing considerably within 100 m from the source and increases in suspended sediment concentrations between 10-20 mg/l expected along the plume [5078].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1 µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1 µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600 mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].

A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.

Includes those priority substances listed in Annex II of Directive 2008/105/EC.","Synthetic compounds used in a variety of substances for commercial applications are carried by shipping tankers and cargo ships.  These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].

1217,Extraction (and disposal) of non-living resources,Maintenance dredging,Radionuclide contamination,"All estuarine/marine sediments are radioactive to different degrees, these may be entirely natural or be naturally-occurring but in enhanced concentrations due to human activities or as a result of nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons production/use [4899].  Radionuclides from several categories may co-exist.  Estuarine and coastal sediments can contain elevated levels of radionuclides as a result of human activity and can reveal a history of local contamination [4483].  The London Convention (LC), modified in 1990s, bans the sea disposal of all radioactive wastes.  However further consideration was required due to ubiquitous nature of radioactivity (natural and artificial), as a strict interpretation of the LC would prohibited all disposal of any materials.  The International Atomic Energy Agency developed the concept of de minimis, for concentrations sufficiently low to allow their disposal; based on the principle, that protection of the human population would ensure adequate protection of non-human populations [4371].  The Environment Agency authorises discharges of radioactive waste to the environment in England, under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 [4372],[4373].  They have assessed the impact of these discharges on Natura 2000 sites [4373], involving the calculation of dose rates to organisms in coastal, freshwater and terrestrial environments.  The total dose rates were compared to a threshold of 40 microgray/h, below which the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales agreed there would be no adverse effect to the integrity of a Natura 2000 sites.  The total dose rates are less than 40 microgray/h for all but two Natura 2000 sites (Ribble and Alt Estuaries SPA and Drigg Coast SAC).  The calculated total dose rate to the worst affected organism for the Ribble and Alt Estuaries SAC was 520 microgray/h, significantly in excess of the threshold.  A further assessment has been undertaken and new limits for industry on the Ribble implemented to ensure that the dose will be less than 40 microgray/h [4375].  The total dose rate for the Drigg Coast SAC is just greater than the 40 microgray/h threshold [4373].  Under the LC dredged material containing radioactivity at/below de minimis levels can be disposed of at sea; regulators require an assessment where compliance with de minimis levels has not been established or may be exceeded.  A 2006 review for dredging operations in England and Wales found that in most regions radionuclide concentrations fell well within de minimis criteria [4374].  Dredging operations in the Irish Sea included material that approached the de minimis criteria, these higher doses at ports such as Mayport on the Cumbrian coast, were due to a combination of artificial radionuclides released from the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing plant (especially 137 Cs, 241 Am, Pu isotopes) and enhanced levels of naturally-occurring radionuclides resulting from non-nuclear industry (phosphate processing) near Whitehaven [4374],[4484],[4899],[4375].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

The mobilisation of sediment due to vessel movements, dredging, and disposal (including disposal associated with habitat creation) can increase levels of organic matter and nutrients [3145],[2838].  However, monitoring has shown that elevated nutrient and organic matter levels following most dredging campaigns are localised, temporal and maybe within natural variability [4899].  Disposal of wastes including regulated discharge of wastewater into the marine environment can result in nutrient enrichment [4915],[3185],[2293],[3096].

Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water, these include bacteria and other microbes, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species.  It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].  Artificial structures in the marine environment e.g. breakwaters and jetties, have the potential to act as ‘stepping stones’ for the spread of non-native species.

The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.  Given the dynamic nature of many disposal sites, the water column is likely to be rapidly re-oxygenated, making any changes localised and very short-lived [3163],[2834],[4891].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1 m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]; and scouring of  6m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6 m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].

Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1 m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6 m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6 m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].

Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water, these include bacteria and other microbes, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species.  It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].  Artificial structures in the marine environment e.g. breakwaters and jetties, have the potential to act as ‘stepping stones’ for the spread of non-native species.

Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (super tankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177].  Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water, these include bacteria and other microbes, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species.  It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].  Artificial structures in the marine environment e.g. breakwaters and jetties, have the potential to act as ‘stepping stones’ for the spread of non-native species.  For example, the Australasian barnacle has been found to colonize concrete breakwaters rapidly in the Netherlands [5086].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity - including in relation to the size of the water body, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

Vessel movements result in the pressure due to the generation of waves and propeller-induced turbidity in the water column.  The suspension of sediments from the bottom and margins of navigation channels can occur as a result of vessel movements.  Vessel movements can also result in erosion at channel margins.  The amount of sediment mobilised will depend on the speed, size, and position of the vessel, plus the water depth and sediment characteristics.

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (super tankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].  Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Marine litter consists of: plastics, wood, metals, glass, rubber, clothing, paper etc.  Litter derived from shipping vessels including pallets, strapping bans, cargo/containers lost at sea, is a minor component of marine litter, contributing 2% of the litter found on UK beaches.  Ports and harbours generate litter from a number of sources including operational and domestic waste from vessels, waste from cargo activities, waste from maintenance activities and marine industry activities, plus domestic (office) waste.  The latter is not unique to ports/harbours, but the however the other sources if not properly managed have the potential to impacts on the environment.

For example, a proposed breakwater extension project in Cowes, Isle of Wight was predicted to cause up to a 60 % reduction in significant wave height inside the breakwater and an increase in wave reflection from northerly winds outside the breakwater [4892].  Local changes in shore profile and topography associated with the disposal of dredged material for environmental beneficial use, intertidal or beach recharge, and the re-profiling of the shore to enable habitat creation can also result in changes to wave exposure [2838],[1669],[1674],[3085].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1287,Transport,Cargo operations and landward transportation,Underwater noise changes,"Ports construction and maintenance works and on-going operations can result in underwater noise, including from vessels, dredging, engineering works.  Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (super tankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20kg ) [4916].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light from vessels may also be of concern where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [3083],[3088],[3195],[2797],[3107],[4334],[4399].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.

Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].

Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].

This results in localised changes flow rates and tidal regime, intercepting flows causing changes in speed and direction to flow round, past, or across new structures e.g. coastal developments, ports and harbour structures, jetties, breakwaters, land reclaim, dredge disposal, habitat creation.  The magnitude and effect will be related to the size, type, and shape of the structure/placement of material, the magnitude of change to the seabed/estuary profile compared to the overall size of the system/estuary [2817],[3079],[3154],[3159],[3153],[3161],[3106],[3082],[4892],[4893],[3145],[5075],[4873].  For example a large reclaim or structure at the mouth of an estuary could result in  changes which impact an entire estuary and the surrounding marine environment, whereas a new small structure within an estuary is likely to result in more limited localised changes [4892],[3079],[4376].  Similarly changing seabed/estuary profile due to the removal of substrate (capital dredging) or structures (decommissioning) will result in similar changes, causing localised changes to the hydrodynamic flow in an area.

Operation of infrastructure can change seabed due to the continuous disturbance e.g. ongoing use of berths, moorings, anchoring, and navigation channels.  The degree and duration of change will depend on the frequency, magnitude, and location of activity, type of seabed substrate and sensitivity of benthic communities.  Where activities occur over sensitive habitats (e.g. shellfish beds, sea grass, maerl, reefs) and/or areas are heavily used, the opportunity and degree of recovery of habitats can be limited and result in a permanent/long-term change to benthic communities and habitat composition [3145].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1313,Coastal management activities,Land reclaim,Underwater noise changes,"Ports construction and maintenance works and on-going operations can result in underwater noise, including from vessels, dredging, engineering works.  Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600 mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

Deliberate discharges of oil or oil/water mixtures from ships are prohibited within the North West European Waters Special Area, established by the International Maritime Organization under MARPOL Annex I in 1999.  This includes all waters around the UK and its approaches. However, accidental discharges still occur.  Information on accidental discharges of oil from ships and offshore platforms is compiled by the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency each year.  Although the majority of incidents are minor, several incidents occur annually that have led to the actual or potential release of significant amounts of oil (typically from large shipping vessels and tankers) [3096],[3106],[3164],[4968],[4972],[4985].  Organic based contaminants such as PAHs can be effectively ‘locked into’ the seabed sediments in ports and harbours.  These stable compounds do not decompose readily; subsequent re-mobilisation (e.g. by dredging) can release these contaminants into the water column.  The likelihood and severity of any impact depends upon the type and degree of sediment contamination and level of re-mobilisation of the sediment.  The highest levels of contaminants generally occur in fine sediment in industrialised estuaries.  However, the occurrence of very contaminated sediments is rare in the England [2838],[3159],[3163],[4899],[3145].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).","The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1322,Coastal management activities,Land reclaim,"Synthetic compound contamination (incl. pesticides, antifoulants, pharmaceuticals).  Includes those priority substances listed in Annex II of Directive 2008/105/EC.","Synthetic compounds used in a variety of substances for commercial applications are carried by shipping tankers and cargo ships.  These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].  Synthetic compounds e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be effectively ‘locked into’ the seabed sediments in ports and harbours.  These stable compounds do not decompose readily.

1323,Coastal management activities,Land reclaim,"Introduction of other substances (solid, liquid or gas)","Ports and Harbour activity can result in the accidental, operational, incidental release of substances (e.g. via vessels/vehicles from ballast water, antifoulants, hull contamination, waste products, litter), much of which is restricted/regulated [3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[3160],[3159].

Activities can also result in the re-mobilisation of contaminants/substances (e.g. from sediments) during construction/maintenance/operational activities.  The likelihood and severity of any impact depends upon the type and degree of existing contamination and intensity of activity.  High levels of contaminants do occur in fine sediments of some industrialised estuaries.

1324,Coastal management activities,Land reclaim,Deoxygenation,"The pressure is associated with sediment mobilisation and increased of suspended sediments as well as the deposition of organic matter.  The pressure can result from a variety of ports and harbour activities including dredging, dredge disposal including alternative disposal and beneficial use of sediments , mobilisation of sediment due to vessel movements and construction activities [2834],[3096],[3153],[3161],[3163],[3106],[3159].  The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.  Given the dynamic nature of many disposal sites, the water column is likely to be rapidly re-oxygenated, making any changes localised and very short-lived [3163],[2834],[4891].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177].  Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water, these include bacteria and other microbes, small invertebrates, eggs, cysts and larvae of various species.  It is estimated that 4,500 different species are carried around the world at any one time in ballast tanks.  During the last three decades, a significant number of introduced, non-indigenous species have been transported through ships’ ballast tanks [5023],[3164].  Artificial structures in the marine environment e.g. breakwaters and jetties, have the potential to act as ‘stepping stones’ for the spread of non-native species.

Piles used in coastal developments can be driven to depths of over -30m Chart Datum, tubular piles are typically 1-2 m diameter, sheet piles typically 0.5-1m wide and 0.1-0.2m thick [4896],[4898],[4890].  Vessel movements can cause localised scour of the seabed, in shallow water, berth pockets, and navigation channels [5174],[3145].  Anchors can penetrate and disturb the seabed on deployment/recovery and due to dragging of the anchor and anchor chain.  The anchors of large vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed up to 1m [4971], while small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4m2 [5175]; and scouring of 6m radius has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].  Mooring chains from swinging moorings can also scour/disturb the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223].  Navigation dredging and excavation activities result in the penetration of the seabed due to the physical removal of substrate [3082],[2838],[3159]; the depth of penetration during capital dredging can be several metres.  For example, in Southampton it was necessary to deepen the existing berths by 4-6m as part of a berth extension project [4890].

1332,Transport,Vessel berths,"Water flow (tidal current) changes, including sediment transport considerations","Structures or material placed in the marine environment associated with ports and harbours (including solid and piled structures) will change the form/profile of an area of seabed or an estuary.  This results in localised changes flow rates and tidal regime, intercepting flows causing changes in speed and direction to flow round, past, or across new structures e.g. coastal developments, ports and harbour structures, jetties, breakwaters, land reclaim, dredge disposal, habitat creation.  The magnitude and effect will be related to the size, type, and shape of the structure/placement of material, the magnitude of change to the seabed/estuary profile compared to the overall size of the system/estuary [2817],[3079],[3154],[3159],[3153],[3161],[3106],[3082],[4892],[4893],[3145],[5075],[4873].

Similarly changing seabed/estuary profile due to the removal of substrate (capital dredging) or structures (decommissioning) will result in similar changes, causing localised changes to the hydrodynamic flow in an area.  The magnitude and type of effect relates to the overall size of the excavation/removal compared to the overall size of the system/estuary, these changes are then sustained by maintenance dredging [3145],[4899],[2838],[3082],[3134].

Construction and presence of structures in ports and harbours will cause a change in habitat type, typically from soft sediment to a hard substratum type; examples include steel piles used in berths/jetties, concrete and rock used in breakwaters/quays [4892],[4890].  Operation of infrastructure can change seabed due to the continuous disturbance e.g. ongoing use of berths, moorings, anchoring, and navigation channels.  The degree and duration of change will depend on the frequency, magnitude, and location of activity, type of seabed substrate and sensitivity of benthic communities.  Where activities occur over sensitive habitats (e.g. shellfish beds, sea grass, maerl, reefs) and/or areas are heavily used, the opportunity and degree of recovery of habitats can be limited and result in a permanent/long-term change to benthic communities and habitat composition [3145].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (super tankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m.

Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Vessels are documented to have collided with mobile marine species (particularly marine mammals).  Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].  Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, ferries (particularly the newer models of high-speed ferry), cruise liners, navy ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.  Species can collide with the propeller or other parts of the hull.  The most lethal and serious injuries are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots [5120].  Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long.  Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].  A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds.  The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures.  The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.  Given the dynamic nature of many disposal sites, the water column is likely to be rapidly re-oxygenated, making any changes localised and very short-lived [3163],[2834],[4891].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.

The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

1419,Coastal management activities,Habitat creation,"Water flow (tidal current) changes, including sediment transport considerations","Structures or material placed in the marine environment associated with ports and harbours (including solid and piled structures) will change the form/profile of an area of seabed or an estuary.  This results in localised changes flow rates and tidal regime, intercepting flows causing changes in speed and direction to flow round, past, or across new structures e.g. coastal developments, ports and harbour structures, jetties, breakwaters, land reclaim, dredge disposal, habitat creation.  The magnitude and effect will be related to the size, type, and shape of the structure/placement of material, the magnitude of change to the seabed/estuary profile compared to the overall size of the system/estuary [2817],[3079],[3154],[3159],[3153],[3161],[3106],[3082],[4892],[4893],[3145],[5075],[4873].  For example a large reclaim or structure at the mouth of an estuary could result in  changes which impact an entire estuary and the surrounding marine environment, whereas a new small structure within an estuary is likely to result in more limited localised changes [4892],[3079],[4376].  Similarly changing seabed/estuary profile due to the removal of substrate (capital dredging) or structures (decommissioning) will result in similar changes, causing localised changes to the hydrodynamic flow in an area.  The magnitude and type of effect relates to the overall size of the excavation/removal compared to the overall size of the system/estuary, these changes are then sustained by maintenance dredging [3145],[4899],[2838],[3082],[3134].

Local changes in shore profile and topography associated with the disposal of dredged material for environmental beneficial use, intertidal or beach recharge, and the re-profiling of the shore to enable habitat creation can also result in changes to wave exposure [2838],[1669],[1674],[3085].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Construction and presence of structures in ports and harbours will cause a change in habitat type, typically from soft sediment to a hard substratum type; examples include steel piles used in berths/jetties, concrete and rock used in breakwaters/quays [4892],[4890].  Construction activities associated with excavation and navigation dredging result in the physical removal of substrate and associated habitats and species resulting in a change in seabed type.  The degree of change will depend on the sensitivity and recoverability of the communities and frequency, duration and magnitude of activity.  Changes in seabed type can also arise from the alteration of the topography, hydrography, and sediment compositions associated resulting from these activities.  Alteration of hydrodynamic conditions as a result of capital dredge (or land reclaim) can change seabed sediment composition and distribution e.g. reduced current flow causing deposition of finer sediment and consequential change in benthic community. Capital dredging can also remove substrate to a depth that the underlying substrate is altered, thus result in a change in habitat and benthic community [2838],[3134],[3145],[3159],[4899],[4379],[4380].

Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600 mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20 kg ) [4916].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Seabirds can be impacted directly by a wide range of artificial light sources within marine environment: seabirds can be attracted to and collide with lighthouses, coastal resorts and other urban lighting, offshore hydrocarbon platforms, commercial fishing vessels and other boats using lights [4378],[4337].  Evidence indicates some bird species are attracted to light sources, which may increase the risk of bird strikes.  Most related studies conclude that increased darkness, coupled with inclement weather, increases attraction by birds to lighted vessels and structures.  Birds drawn to light often become disoriented and can then collide with these vessels/structures resulting in injury and death [4377].  In the case of vessels, it known that nocturnal bird strikes tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore); however, here are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels [4378],[4337].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal is very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. One of most significant activities during construction is foundation installation, with measurements available of pile installation using both impact and vibro pile hammers. The most relevant of these is a measurement of wind turbine monopile foundation installation, giving Source Levels of 215 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m. Both physical and behavioural effects on marine wildlife have been noted [4906]. The available information indicates an average figure for ambient noise in the marine environment of approximately 70 dB. The available information also indicates that pile driving noise (for 4 to 5 m diameter piles) can be as high as of 260 to 270 dB re 1 µPa at source [4964] at a range of 20 Hz to > 20 kHz with most energy around 100 to 200 Hz [4906],[5166]. However, piles for wave and tidal projects are likely to be smaller than this. Also, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125].Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater. Different parts of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas.

Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103].

Includes those priority substances listed in Annex II of Directive 2008/105/EC.","Synthetic compounds used in a variety of substances for commercial applications are carried by shipping tankers and cargo ships.  These can be spilled into the sea through loss of cargo, collision, grounding, mechanical failure, and deliberate dumping.  Many of these compounds are considered toxic or hazardous.  Accidental spillages around the UK are generally rare.  Chemicals can also be released into the sea through ships ‘flushing’, or washing, their tanks and clearing ballast water [3096],[3106],[3107],[3164],[3157],[4968],[4972].  For example it is currently legal to discharge Polyisobutene (PIB) from ships into the marine environment under certain conditions; PIB is a man-made synthetic product used in the manufacture of sealants, adhesive tape and chewing gum.  PIB is a hydrophobic substance though, so on contact with water it coalesces into a waxy, glue-like formation, generally floating at or just underneath the surface.  As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].  Synthetic compounds e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be effectively ‘locked into’ the seabed sediments in ports and harbours.  These stable compounds do not decompose readily.  Subsequent re-mobilisation of the sediments (e.g. by dredging) can release these contaminants into the water column. The likelihood and severity of any impact depends upon the type and degree of sediment contamination and level of re-mobilisation of the sediment.

The extent and nature of the changes will depend on the dynamic nature and physical characteristics of the area, sediment type, temperature; making changes in many cases short lived and localised [4891].  For example the release of organic rich sediments during dredging or disposal can result in the localised removal of oxygen from the surrounding water [3159],[2834],[3163],[4899].  Dredging activities in areas with an existing problem with dissolved oxygen, or extensive dredging of sediments with a high chemical oxygen demand, could affect dissolved oxygen.  However, in practice, monitoring data suggests that such effects are unlikely in most cases [4902].  Following the placement of dredged material at a disposal site, there is the potential for some localised reduction in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water column.  Given the dynamic nature of many disposal sites, the water column is likely to be rapidly re-oxygenated, making any changes localised and very short-lived [3163],[2834],[4891].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery. Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide. The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m  occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971].

As such it is extremely hazardous to a range of seabird species, which dive to find food [4975].  Synthetic compounds e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can be effectively ‘locked into’ the seabed sediments in ports and harbours.  These stable compounds do not decompose readily.  Subsequent re-mobilisation of the sediments (e.g. by dredging) can release these contaminants into the water column. The likelihood and severity of any impact depends upon the type and degree of sediment contamination and level of re-mobilisation of the sediment.  The highest levels of contaminants generally occur in fine sediment in industrialised estuaries.  However, the occurrence of very contaminated sediments is rare in the England [2838],[3159],[4899],[3145].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).","The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1522,Coastal Infrastructure,Piling: Port and Harbours,Underwater noise changes,"Ports construction and maintenance works and on-going operations can result in underwater noise, including from vessels, dredging, engineering works.  Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, bird, mammals [3152],[3164],[3159],[3106],[2074],[3128],[3069],[4995].  Shipping vessels are important source of underwater noise, and is the dominant contributor to ambient noise in shallow water areas close to shipping lanes and in deeper waters [5173],[5172].  Shipping noise is most evident in the 50-300 Hz frequency range, with the majority of noise coming from propeller cavitation, on-board machinery, and turbulence around the hull.  The noise emitted from vessels varies, in general larger vessels generate lower frequency sound.  The source levels associated with large ships (supertankers/container ships) is in the range 180-190 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS).  Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [3096],[4908].  Measurements of underwater noise from backhoe dredging operations have indicated that the highest levels of underwater noise occur when the excavator is in contact with the seabed.  Dredging produces broadband and continuous sound, mainly at lower frequencies (<1 kHz; source sound pressure levels 160 to more than 190 dB re 1 µPa at 1 m) [4908],[3152].  However it is impulsive/impact sound generated by explosives/piling which causes the most concern of injury and displacement of mobile species from underwater noise [3152],[2074],[3128],[3069].  Impact piling generates high levels of underwater noise, a typical peak to peak source noise pressure levels underwater for tubular piles used in coastal environments range of 220-235 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m. Sheet piling noise is generally lower with typical predicted peak to peak source noise level of 212 dB re. 1 uPa @ 1 m (for 600mm sheet pile) [4908].Engineering works in coastal environments using blasting to remove unwanted hard substrate can to produce source peak noise levels of 257 dB re: 1 µPa (borehole blasting with a charge of 20kg ) [4916].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1523,Coastal Infrastructure,Piling: Coastal flood and erosion risk management schemes,Underwater noise changes,"Piling can create noise that may impact marine mammals and fish spawning and other sensitive life cycle stages. Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. However, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125]. Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, on-board machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in noise being transmitted underwater. Different part of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas.",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

The magnitude and effect will be related to the size, type, and shape of the structure/placement of material, the magnitude of change to the seabed/estuary profile compared to the overall size of the system/estuary [2817],[3079],[3154],[3159],[3153],[3161],[3106],[3082],[4892],[4893],[3145],[5075],[4873].  For example a large reclaim or structure at the mouth of an estuary could result in  changes which impact an entire estuary and the surrounding marine environment, whereas a new small structure within an estuary is likely to result in more limited localised changes [4892],[3079],[4376].  Similarly changing seabed/estuary profile due to the removal of substrate (capital dredging) or structures (decommissioning) will result in similar changes, causing localised changes to the hydrodynamic flow in an area.  The magnitude and type of effect relates to the overall size of the excavation/removal compared to the overall size of the system/estuary, these changes are then sustained by maintenance dredging [3145],[4899],[2838],[3082],[3134].

1541,Coastal Infrastructure,Coastal flood and erosion risk management schemes: Construction,Underwater noise changes,"Piling can create noise that may impact marine mammals and fish spawning and other sensitive life cycle stages. Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. However, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125]. Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, on-board machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in noise being transmitted underwater. Different part of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. The dredging of material will result in underwater noise similar to that generated in other marine operations such the use of sonars, seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc. [3804],[4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide. 
The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m  occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971]. There is a tendency for the anchor to penetrate to deep depths in softer sediment as the opening of the anchor flukes prevents deep penetration in harder sediment [5076].

Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. However, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125]. Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, on-board machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in noise being transmitted underwater. Different part of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. The dredging of material will result in underwater noise similar to that generated in other marine operations such the use of sonars, seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc. [3804],[4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987].
A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].

1740,Energy generation,Tidal stream: Construction,Underwater noise changes,"The construction and operation of a wave or tidal energy projects can create noise that may impact marine mammals and fish spawning and other sensitive life cycle stages. Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal is very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. One of most significant activities during construction is foundation installation, with measurements available of pile installation using both impact and vibro pile hammers. The most relevant of these is a measurement of wind turbine monopile foundation installation, giving Source Levels of 215 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m. Both physical and behavioural effects on marine wildlife have been noted [4906]. The available information indicates an average figure for ambient noise in the marine environment of approximately 70 dB. The available information also indicates that pile driving noise (for 4 to 5 m diameter piles) can be as high as of 260 to 270 dB re 1 µPa at source [4964] at a range of 20 Hz to > 20 kHz with most energy around 100 to 200 Hz [4906],[5166]. However, piles for wave and tidal projects are likely to be smaller than this. Also, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125].Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater. Different parts of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. Seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc are all sources of underwater noise [4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death.

The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. Noise generated during sonar operations have been linked with behavioural changes even stranding in marine mammals [5077]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Development near the coast can result in barriers to species movement through increased noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].

The physical presence of an energy generating device could lead to diffraction or funnelling of waves and currents, reductions in the wave energy reaching the coast and changes in local wave patterns [4960]. This may lead to the development of scour pits adjacent to foundations or secondary scour around scour protection [3148]. Artificial reefs may have directly negative impacts through changes in current velocities and direction [4980],[5018],[5021],[2293]. Structures added to the coastal environment as a result of coastal defence schemes, coastal developments, artificial reefs, tidal range projects etc., can change local flow conditions.

1763,Energy generation,Tidal lagoon/impoundment: Construction,Underwater noise changes,"The construction and operation of tidal energy projects can create noise that may impact marine mammals and fish spawning and other sensitive life cycle stages. Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal is very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. One of most significant activities during construction is foundation installation, with measurements available of pile installation using both impact and vibro pile hammers. The most relevant of these is a measurement of wind turbine monopile foundation installation, giving Source Levels of 215 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m. Both physical and behavioural effects on marine wildlife have been noted [4906]. The available information indicates an average figure for ambient noise in the marine environment of approximately 70 dB. The available information also indicates that pile driving noise (for 4 to 5 m diameter piles) can be as high as of 260 to 270 dB re 1 µPa at source [4964] at a range of 20 Hz to > 20 kHz with most energy around 100 to 200 Hz [4906],[5166]. Factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125]. Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater. Different parts of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. Seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc are all sources of underwater noise [4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light from vessels may also be of concern where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [3083],[3088],[3195],[2797],[3107],[4334],[4339].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

The presence of vessels and structures as they are installed may cause a barrier to species movement that can be temporary or longer term [3125],[3148]. The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. Noise generated during sonar operations have been linked with behavioural changes even stranding in marine mammals [5077]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Development near the coast can result in barriers to species movement through increased noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].

Artificial hard substrata offers new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385]. Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur. All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177]. Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water [3164].

This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The construction of numerous windmills off the Belgian coast was used to study the colonisation of non-indigenous species on these new artificial structures, monitoring the fouling communities of the wind farms on a regular basis from the beginning of their installation [4385]. They demonstrated that the new artificial hard substrata of the windmills offer new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea. Or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385].

Damage to the seabed may be caused by deployment of anchors from vessels used in maintenance, the subsequent dragging and locking in of anchors and through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery [3223]. The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m  occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971].

Artificial reefs may have directly negative impacts through changes in current velocities and direction [4980],[5018],[5021],[2293]. Structures added to the coastal environment as a result of coastal defence schemes, coastal developments, artificial reefs, etc., can change local flow conditions.

In the case of tidal stream farms the operational noise from a small number of units may not exceed threshold levels, but the cumulative noise production from large numbers of units has the potential to mask the communication and echolocation sounds produced by aquatic organisms in the vicinity of the structures. Resolution of the significance or otherwise of noise impacts will require information about the device's acoustic signature (e.g., sound pressure levels across the full range of frequencies) for both individual units and multiple-unit arrays, similar characterization of ambient noise in the vicinity of the farm, the hearing sensitivity of fish and marine mammals that inhabit the area, and information about the behavioural responses to anthropogenic noise (e.g., avoidance, attraction, changes in schooling behaviour or migration routes) [ 5194].

Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light emissions associated with offshore structures could have a potential impact through attraction of birds due to illumination by navigational lights and subsequent increase in the risk of collision [3125].

1829,Energy generation,Wave: Operation and maintenance,Barrier to species movement,"The pressure refers to obstructions to species movement caused by physical barrier or prolonged exposure to noise, light, visual disturbance or changes in water quality. The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. The presence of tidal/ wave farms can lead to a behavioural response (displacement from habitat and extension of flights/movement) for mobile species, effectively causing a barrier to movement [5162],[5166]. They may represent a barrier to movement of migrating or feeding animals and may potentially result in displacement of migration routes and displacement of feeding animals. Such displacements may incur heavier energetic costs, which may ultimately affect survival or breeding success  [3125]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increased noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The construction of numerous windmills off the Belgian coast was used to study the colonisation of non-indigenous species on these new artificial structures, monitoring the fouling communities of the wind farms on a regular basis from the beginning of their installation [4385]. They demonstrated that the new artificial hard substrata of the windmills offer new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea. Or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385]. Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur. All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177].

For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971].

This may lead to the development of scour pits adjacent to turbine foundations or secondary scour around scour protection [3148]. Artificial reefs may have directly negative impacts through changes in current velocities and direction [4980],[5018],[5021],[2293]. Structures added to the coastal environment as a result of coastal defence schemes, coastal developments, artificial reefs, etc., can change local flow conditions.

1874,Energy generation,Offshore wind: Construction (if relevant see also Cables),Underwater noise changes,"The construction and operation of an offshore wind farm can create noise that may impact marine mammals and fish spawning and other sensitive life cycle stages. Important parameters are peak pressure, received energy (received sound pressure level), signal duration, spectral type, frequency (range), duty cycle, directionality and signal rise times. Possible effects on marine mammals can be divided into behavioural disturbance (including displacement), masking, and injury either as temporary threshold shift (TTS), permanent threshold shift (PTS) or other injuries such as tissue damage and, in extreme cases, death if the animal very close to pile-driving activities [3125]. One of most significant activities during windfarm construction is foundation installation, with measurements available of pile installation using both impact and vibro pile hammers. The most relevant of these is a measurement of wind turbine monopile foundation installation, giving Source Levels of 215 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m. Both physical and behavioural effects on marine wildlife have been noted [4906]. The available information indicates an average figure for ambient noise in the marine environment of approximately 70 dB. The available information also indicates that pile driving noise (for 4 to 5 m diameter piles) can be as high as of 260 to 270 dB re 1 µPa at source [4964] at a range of 20 Hz to > 20 kHz with most energy around 100 to 200 Hz [4906],[5166]. However, factors such as pile diameter, water depth, geology and sea bed topography can all influence noise generation and propagation so values are likely to vary from site to site [3125].Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater. Different part of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. Seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc are all sources of underwater noise [4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. Noise generated during sonar operations have been linked with behavioural changes even stranding in marine mammals [5077]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increase noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

1888,Energy generation,Offshore wind: Operation and maintenance (if relevant see also Cables),Introduction or spread of invasive non-indigenous species (INIS),"There is a world-wide concern of the expansion of non-indigenous species because they alter local biodiversity and sometimes compete with native species, some of which of commercial interest. This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The construction of numerous windmills off the Belgian coast was used to study the colonisation of non-indigenous species on these new artificial structures, monitoring the fouling communities of the wind farms on a regular basis from the beginning of their installation [4385]. They demonstrated that the new artificial hard substrata of the windmills offer new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea. Or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385]. Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur. All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177]. Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water [3164].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

Turbine foundations (e.g. monopiles or pin piles for jacket/ tripod foundations) penetrate into the seabed to provide a sound structure base. Typical pile diameter for offshore wind farms currently installed in the OSPAR area is between 4 and 5 m [3125]. Damage to the seabed may be caused by deployment of anchors from vessels used in maintenance of the windfarm, the subsequent dragging and locking in of anchors and through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery [3223]. The anchors of large shipping and cargo vessels have been found to penetrate the seabed at depths up to approximately 1 m in trials. For example, for an 11.5 tonne anchor penetration of up to 0.88 m occurred in soft sediment when the anchor was dropped and dragged 87 m [4971]. There is a tendency for the anchor to penetrate to deep depths in softer sediment as the opening of the anchor flukes prevents deep penetration in harder sediment [5076].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

1901,Energy generation,Offshore wind: Operation and maintenance (if relevant see also Cables),Underwater noise changes,"The majority of noise in the marine environment due to wind turbines is related to mechanical vibration in the drive train. Monopile turbines produced the highest sound pressure level (SPL) of the foundations at lower frequencies (<200 Hz), with levels of 149 dB re 1 µPa within 5 m of the foundation at 560 Hz. The jacket produced the highest SPL at high frequencies (>500 Hz) with 177 dB re 1 µPa at 700 Hz and 191 dB re 1 µPa at 925 Hz within 5 m of the jacket. These high SPL at high frequency produced by the jacket are associated with structural resonances for which the high SPL is strongly localised to volumes very close to the jacket and dissipate rapidly moving away from the foundation. [4958]. By far the longest phase of a windfarm's lifecycle is the operational phase. Two measurements of offshore wind turbine noise show low frequency sound levels, with a Source Level spectra showing a maximum of 153 dB re 1 mPa @ 1 m at 16 Hz. The measurements are of individual turbines of a relatively low power (less than 1 MW). Despite the low level, low frequency nature of the sound, behavioural reactions have been observed in a study of harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) response to the reproduction of wind turbine noise [4906]. Shipping is an important source of underwater noise. Although the majority of this will come from the propeller cavitation, onboard machinery and turbulence around the hull can also result in underwater noise being transmitted underwater. Different part of the vessel and different vessels emit at different frequencies. Generally, lower frequency with increasing size. Low frequency sounds generally travel farther and have the potential of impacting larger areas. Small sea going vessels typically produce broadband noise at source levels of 160-180 dB re 1µPa-m (RMS) [4915],[4908].Seismic prospecting in the oil and gas industry, acoustic deterrents/harassing devices, turbine operation, piling, explosives, etc are all sources of underwater noise [4921],[4995],[5173],[5172].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light emissions associated with offshore wind turbines could have a potential impact through attraction of birds due to illumination by navigational lights and subsequent increase in the risk of collision [3125].

The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. The presence of offshore wind farms can lead to a behavioural response (displacement from habitat and extension of flights) for seabirds, effectively causing a barrier to movement [5162],[5166]. They may represent a barrier to movement of migrating or feeding birds and may potentially result in displacement of migration routes and displacement of feeding birds. Such displacements may incur heavier energetic costs, which may ultimately affect survival or breeding success  [3125]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increase noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

All craft have some biofouling, even if recently cleaned or anti-fouled [4978],[5177]. Thousands of marine species can be carried in ships’ ballast water [3164]. There is a world-wide concern of the expansion of non-indigenous species because they alter local biodiversity and sometimes compete with native species, some of which of commercial interest. This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The construction of numerous windmills off the Belgian coast was used to study the colonisation of non-indigenous species on these new artificial structures, monitoring the fouling communities of the wind farms on a regular basis from the beginning of their installation [4385]. They demonstrated that the new artificial hard substrata of the windmills offer new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea. Or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity - including in relation to the size of the water body, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death.

The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. The presence of offshore wind farms can lead to a behavioural response (displacement from habitat and extension of flights) for seabirds, effectively causing a barrier to movement [5162],[5166]. This pressure will continue until turbines are fully removed and therefore remains present during the decommissioning process as this may take place over several months/ years. Offshore windfarms may represent a barrier to movement of migrating or feeding birds and may potentially result in displacement of migration routes and displacement of feeding birds. Such displacements may incur heavier energetic costs, which may ultimately affect survival or breeding success  [3125]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increase noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Several reports have concluded that offshore wind farms pose a collision risk, particularly at migratory ""bottleneck"" locations, to a range of bird receptors (e.g. [4954],[5161],[5164],[5165],  and therefore could require mitigation measures. The collision risk of marine birds is deemed to be higher at night than during the day, but overall is deemed to be low because of their high visibility even in poor light conditions [3098].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. A lack of information exists regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

The physical presence of an energy generating device could lead to diffraction or funnelling of waves and currents, reductions in the wave energy reaching the coast and changes in local wave patterns [4960].

In the case of tidal stream farms the operational noise from a small number of units may not exceed threshold levels, but the cumulative noise production from large numbers of units has the potential to mask the communication and echolocation sounds produced by aquatic organisms in the vicinity of the structures. Resolution of the significance or otherwise of noise impacts will require information about the device's acoustic signature (e.g., sound pressure levels across the full range of frequencies) for both individual units and multiple-unit arrays, similar characterization of ambient noise in the vicinity of the farm, the hearing sensitivity of fish and marine mammals that inhabit the area, and information about the behavioural responses to anthropogenic noise (e.g., avoidance, attraction, changes in schooling behaviour or migration routes) [ 5194].

Light emissions associated with offshore structures could have a potential impact through attraction of birds due to illumination by navigational lights and subsequent increase in the risk of collision [3125].

The scale of the impact will depend on scale of activity and the location and will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to given feature/site. The presence of tidal/ wave farms can lead to a behavioural response (displacement from habitat and extension of flights/movement) for mobile species, effectively causing a barrier to movement [5162],[5166]. They may represent a barrier to movement of migrating or feeding animals and may potentially result in displacement of migration routes and displacement of feeding animals. Such displacements may incur heavier energetic costs, which may ultimately affect survival or breeding success  [3125]. Noise arising from other long-lived operations using explosives such as harbour construction or military activities can also alter migration routes of sensitive species [4990]. Coastal development can result in barriers to species movement through increased noise (e.g. construction, shipping, acoustic deterrents), lighting, presence of structures, changes to water quality and suspended sediments [2817],[3085],[3096],[3106],[3195],[2763],[3111],[3149],[2834],[3151].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

This is especially the case in shallow coastal waters, subject to a multitude of human activities, including the construction of artificial hard substrata. The construction of numerous windmills off the Belgian coast was used to study the colonisation of non-indigenous species on these new artificial structures, monitoring the fouling communities of the wind farms on a regular basis from the beginning of their installation [4385]. They demonstrated that the new artificial hard substrata of the windmills offer new opportunities for non-indigenous species (introduced and southern Northeast Atlantic range-expanding species) to enter the Southern North Sea. Or, if already present, to expand their population size and hence strengthen their strategic position in the Southern North Sea. This is particularly important for the obligate intertidal hard substrata species, for which other offshore habitat is rare to non-existing [4385]. Aquatic organisms may be transferred to new locations as biofouling and can be harmful and invasive in locations where they do not naturally occur.

1988,Production of living resources,Shellfish aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Litter,"Marine litter is items made or used by people and deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost into the sea and on beaches. Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103]. Alongside existing legislation, potential mitigation measures are discussed in various sources of literature [2752],[3160],[5103].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

1989,Production of living resources,Shellfish aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Underwater noise changes,"Vessels and machinery used during the construction phase will increase noise levels. Vessel movement is an important source of underwater noise, with noise emitted typically varying with vessel size whereby larger vessels generate lower frequency sound. Although propeller cavitation is the main source of such noise, gear deployment/towing/hauling, turbulence around the hull and the use of fish finding sonars will also result in noise being transmitted underwater by fishing vessels. For example, the source levels associated with small sea going vessels are typically 160-180 dB (Peak) re 1 µPa-m (RMS) [3152]. Acoustic deterrents/harassing devices are an additional potential source of underwater noise  [3152],[3096],[4921]. Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, birds and mammals [3152],[4921],[2074],[3069],[3121],[4445],[4869].

Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light from vessels may also be of concern where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [2843],[3083],[3088],[3195],[2797],[3107],[4399],[4334],[4337],[2834].

The likelihood of impact will depend on factors such as the spatial/temporal scale of the activity and its location in relation to migratory routes, and so the pressure will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to a given feature/site. Whilst it is considered that examples of the association between this sub-activity and pressure will be rare, potential causes include fixed equipment in confined water bodies/estuaries, or behavioural effects from the use of acoustic deterrents [3121],[3152],[4921],[4445].

Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4399],[4378],[2826]. Bird collisions with vessels have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels. Nocturnal bird strikes on vessels tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel [4466],[4378],[4476],[2826].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. There is a paucity of information regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075].

Aquaculture, like most maritime activities, generates sound as a by-product of ongoing operations, and sound may be associated with constructing, maintaining, and decommissioning aquaculture facilities. In some cases, intense sounds have been intentionally produced to deter predator attacks. As a result, noise can displace animals from their habitat or interrupt normal movement or migration patterns, adversely affect foraging and reproductive behaviour, and increase the risk of predation [3151].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

The spatial and temporal persistence of any change will depend on factors such as the gear type and intensity of the activity, levels of natural disturbance, temperature and the sediment type/composition, resulting in many changes being relatively short lived and localised [4891],[4899],[4351],[4446].

Further, organic matter at the surface may be buried within anaerobic subsurface layers [4450].

Dredging for seed and the harvesting of on-bottom culture shellfish may have impacts on the seabed and benthic communities. Due to their penetrative nature and close contact with the seabed, dredges cause substantial physical disruption to the seafloor by ploughing sediments and damaging organisms [4452]. The magnitude of the immediate response to fishing disturbance, cumulative effects and recovery times varies significantly according to factors such as the type of fishing gear and fishing intensity, the habitat and sediment type, levels of natural disturbance and among different taxa [4471],[4472],[4473],[4410],[3137]. In some countries (e.g. United Kingdom, Ireland) and some operations, seed mussels are dredged once a layer of mussel mud has built up (mussel mud is an accumulation layer of mussel faeces and pseudofaeces which can be 30 to 40cm thick and can detach from the underlying substratum and become unstable). This allows the collection of seed mussels with a relatively small impact on the subsurface fauna. In addition, dredging activities are seasonal, which will allow a period of recovery for the seabed habitat and the benthos [2834]. Vessels may also lay on/dry out at low tide on the seabed. Anchors may also be used if vessels lay on/dry out. Anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery. Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223]. Small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]. Scouring over a 6 m radius around a mooring has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

Turbid plumes can reduce light levels and smother feeding and respiratory organs.

The quantity of suspended material, its spatial and temporal persistence and subsequent patterns of deposition will depend on factors associated with the gear (such as type/design, weight, towing speed), sediment (particle size, composition, compactness), the intensity of the activity and the background hydrographic conditions [3186],[4448],[4446],[4451]. Sediment remobilisation and deposition can affect the settlement, feeding, and survival of biota through smothering of feeding and respiratory organs. Prolonged exposure of an area to the pressure may result in changes in sediment composition [3137],[3186],[1419],[4448],[4451].

2009,Production of living resources,Shellfish aquaculture: Bottom culture,Abrasion/disturbance of the substrate on the surface of the seabed,"Bed disturbance during harvesting operations (e.g. seed harvesting, dredging for oysters, mussels) can cause physical damage to benthic habitats [4915]. Dredging for seed and the harvesting of on-bottom culture shellfish may have impacts on the seabed and benthic communities. Due to their penetrative nature and close contact with the seabed, dredges cause substantial physical disruption to the seafloor by ploughing sediments and damaging organisms [4452]. The magnitude of the immediate response to fishing disturbance, cumulative effects and recovery times varies significantly according to factors such as the type of fishing gear and fishing intensity, the habitat and sediment type, levels of natural disturbance and among different taxa [4471],[4472],[4473],[4410],[3137]. In some countries (e.g. United Kingdom, Ireland) and some operations, seed mussels are dredged once a layer of mussel mud has built up (mussel mud is an accumulation layer of mussel faeces and pseudofaeces which can be 30 to 40 cm thick and can detach from the underlying substratum and become unstable). This allows the collection of seed mussels with a relatively small impact on the subsurface fauna. In addition, dredging activities are seasonal, which will allow a period of recovery for the seabed habitat and the benthos [2834]. Vessels may also lay on/dry out at low tide on the seabed. Anchors may also be used if vessels lay on/dry out. Anchors cause damage to the seabed upon deploying the anchor and the subsequent dragging and locking in and also through the chain causing abrasion and scour whilst at anchor and upon recovery. Mooring chains from swinging moorings may scour the seabed as the mooring slackens and rotates with the tide [3223]. Small vessel anchors have been found to cause surface ‘scars’ of typically 1-4 m2 [5175]. Scouring over a 6 m radius around a mooring has been recorded on intertidal mudflats caused by anchor chains [5179],[4981].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

2012,Production of living resources,Shellfish aquaculture: Bottom culture,Litter,"Marine litter is items made or used by people and deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost into the sea and on beaches. Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103]. Alongside existing legislation, potential mitigation measures are discussed in various sources of literature [2752],[3160],[5103].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

Although propeller cavitation is the main source of such noise, gear deployment/towing/hauling, turbulence around the hull and the use of fish finding sonars will also result in noise being transmitted underwater by fishing vessels [3152],[3096],[4921]. For example, the source levels associated with small sea going vessels and echo sounders are typically 160-180 dB and 235 (Peak) re 1 µPa-m (RMS), respectively [3152].

However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels.

Almost all vessel sizes and classes have been involved in collisions with marine mammals, including cargo ships, recreational vessels, and research vessels.

The primary chemicals of environmental concern in vessel oil and fuel are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Deliberate discharges of oil or oil/water mixtures from ships are prohibited within the North West European Waters Special Area, established by the International Maritime Organization under MARPOL Annex I in 1999. This includes all waters around the UK and its approaches. However, accidental discharges still occur. Information on accidental discharges of oil from ships and offshore platforms is compiled annually by the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS) on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. Although the majority of incidents are minor, several incidents occur annually that lead to the actual or potential release of significant amounts of oil (typically from large shipping vessels and tankers). Antifouling compounds like tributyltin (TBT; banned on vessels under 25 m in the UK since 1987, however) and copper wash from ship coatings enter and persist in the marine environment, with highest concentrations generally found in heavily used shipping routes or within harbours [3096],[3164],[3155],[2788],[3194],[4985].

Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103].

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. There is a paucity of information regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098]. Collision with gear (e.g. nets) can also occur but the consideration of this would be better done through the pressure 'Removal of non-target species'.",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

In some cases, intense sounds have been intentionally produced to deter predator attacks.

Nutrient enrichment of the water column has been detected around sea bream and sea bass cages in the Mediterranean [5134],[5135]. Primary production has been found to increase in farm surroundings under oligotrophic conditions in the Mediterranean Sea, eventually stimulating productivity at higher trophic levels [5136].

The spatial and temporal persistence of any change will depend on factors such as the gear type and intensity of the activity, levels of natural disturbance, temperature and the sediment type/composition, resulting in many changes being relatively short lived and localised [4891],[4899],[4351],[4446]. For fishing, the pressure may result from disturbance of the sediment in the wake of towed gears and resuspension of organic rich sediments [1419],[3186],[1436],[4350],[4407],[4351],[4446],[4899]. Further, organic matter at the surface may be buried within anaerobic subsurface layers [4450]. In fisheries where discards are spatially concentrated, particularly in areas of low current flow, discards (or damage to benthic organisms, including target species) may result in localised increases in organic matter and potentially hypoxia or anoxia of the seabed [3120],[3805]. More generally, shellfish farms can result in sediments that are characterised by suboxic to anoxic conditions due to the deposition of organic material and the associated communities may be affected by this surplus of organic matter [5135],[2834].

2077,Production of living resources,Seaweed aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Litter,"Marine litter is items made or used by people and deliberately discarded or unintentionally lost into the sea and on beaches. Despite international legislation such as Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 [3140], maritime activity is still a major source of litter. Fishing is an important source of marine litter. For example, 14 % of the litter identified during the UK Beachwatch survey (2006) was fishing related [3160], net loss in UK fisheries has been estimated at 36 km per year [5103] and surveys across 32 sites in European waters (continental shelves to canyons) found that derelict fishing gear was the second most abundant item encountered (34 % of total) [4459]. Various types of litter result from fishing in general including galley waste, fish boxes, floats/buoys, nets, ropes, lines, pots, weights and micro-plastic particles resulting from disintegration of plastic gear [3160],[3118]. Impacts of such litter include entanglement of marine wildlife including mammals and birds, ingestion and ghost fishing [3202],[3160],[2752],[3096],[5123],[5103]. Ghost gears can also damage benthic habitats (through abrasion, ‘plucking’ of organisms or meshes closing around them, and the translocation of seabed features) [5103]. Alongside existing legislation, potential mitigation measures are discussed in various sources of literature [2752],[3160],[5103].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

2078,Production of living resources,Seaweed aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Underwater noise changes,"Vessels and machinery used during the construction phase will increase noise levels. Vessel movement is an important source of underwater noise, with noise emitted typically varying with vessel size whereby larger vessels generate lower frequency sound. Although propeller cavitation is the main source of such noise, gear deployment/towing/hauling, turbulence around the hull and the use of fish finding sonars will also result in noise being transmitted underwater by fishing vessels. For example, the source levels associated with small sea going vessels are typically 160-180 dB (Peak) re 1 µPa-m (RMS) [3152]. Acoustic deterrents/harassing devices are an additional potential source of underwater noise  [3152],[3096],[4921]. Underwater noise can result in disturbance particularly to mobile receptors such as fish, birds and mammals [3152],[4921],[2074],[3069],[3121],[4445],[4869]. Disturbance to species and their displacement from the site can arise from the construction and the operation of aquaculture farms, for instance from noise and light during management activities or the need to control predation on farms [2834].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

2079,Production of living resources,Seaweed aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Introduction of light,"The pressure is potentially associated with construction, maintenance, operational lighting, plus navigation and operational lighting on vessels and structures. Lighting can cause disorientation or displace sensitive species. Lighted vessels and structures in open waters may pose a collision risk to many species of birds. Birds drawn to light may become disoriented and collide with these structures, which may result in injury and death. Light from vessels may also be of concern where significant levels of activity occur in close proximity to sensitive bird habitats including coastal inshore waters [2843],[3083],[3088],[3195],[2797],[3107],[4399],[4334],[4337],[2834].

The likelihood of impact will depend on factors such as the spatial/temporal scale of the activity and its location in relation to migratory routes, and so the pressure will need to be considered on case-by-case basis to determine relevance to a given feature/site. Whilst it is considered that examples of the association between this sub-activity and pressure will be rare, potential causes include fixed equipment in confined water bodies/estuaries, or behavioural effects from the use of acoustic deterrents [3121],[3152],[4921],[4445].

Marine birds are frequently attracted to or become disorientated by artificial light sources, which can result in collision and therefore injury or death [4399],[4378],[2826]. Bird collisions with vessels have been recorded with the risk being greatest at night for lighted ships near coastal areas and when the vessel is relatively close to large breeding aggregations of seabirds (rather than further offshore). However, there are relatively few sources of quantified information relating to seabird strikes on vessels. Nocturnal bird strikes on vessels tend to occur when bright, artificial light sources are used at times of poor visibility, typically during bad weather, often angled outwards or upwards from the vessel [4466],[4378],[4476],[2826].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase as a result of non-compliance to legislation, codes of conduct or best practice (see Activity-Pressure justification text).

In general, the most lethal and serious injuries to mobile species such as marine mammals are caused by large ships (e.g. 80 m or longer) and vessels travelling at speeds faster than 14 knots. Most minor injuries, by contrast, involved collisions with vessels less than 45 m long. Collisions are rarely reported for vessels doing less than 10 km/hour [5120],[4987]. There is a paucity of information regarding collision risk of animals (e.g. birds, fish, marine mammals) with underwater structures, especially for birds. The response of birds will depend on their detection of a device and any associated structures. The risk of collision may be increased if the devices alter the characteristics of the current, especially if such changes create new foraging opportunities, since this may impact on the manoeuvrability and underwater swimming agility of birds [4959],[5075]. Collision risks are most likely to pose the greatest risk in areas of strong water movement, such as areas of strong tidal flow or wave motion [3098].",low,"The risk of this pressure will increase depending on the spatial/ temporal scale and intensity of the activity, the proximity of the activity to the feature (in space and time) and the sensitivity of the feature to the pressure.

Aquaculture, like most maritime activities, generates sound as a by-product of ongoing operations, and sound may be associated with constructing, maintaining, and decommissioning aquaculture facilities. In some cases, intense sounds have been intentionally produced to deter predator attacks. As a result, noise can displace animals from their habitat or interrupt normal movement or migration patterns, adversely affect foraging and reproductive behaviour, and increase the risk of predation [3151].",medium-high,,"The associated evidence follows NE's evidence standards, particularly for ""Analysis of Evidence"" (NESTND024) and ""Conservation Advice for MPAs"" (NESTND036).

2087,Production of living resources,Seaweed aquaculture: Suspended rope/net culture,Deoxygenation,"This pressure is associated with sediment mobilisation as well as the deposition of organic matter. The spatial and temporal persistence of any change will depend on factors such as the gear type and intensity of the activity, levels of natural disturbance, temperature and the sediment type/composition, resulting in many changes being relatively short lived and localised [4891],[4899],[4351],[4446]. For fishing, the pressure may result from disturbance of the sediment in the wake of towed gears and resuspension of organic rich sediments [1419],[3186],[1436],[4350],[4407],[4351],[4446],[4899]. Further, organic matter at the surface may be buried within anaerobic subsurface layers [4450]. In fisheries where discards are spatially concentrated, particularly in areas of low current flow, discards (or damage to benthic organisms, including target species) may result in localised increases in organic matter and potentially hypoxia or anoxia of the seabed [3120],[3805]. More generally, shellfish farms can result in sediments that are characterised by suboxic to anoxic conditions due to the deposition of organic material and the associated communities may be affected by this surplus of organic matter [5135],[2834].
