Marine Pressures-Activities Database (PAD) v1.3

Coastal and marine ecosystems are subject to a number of human-induced pressures associated with a variety of marine activities. As such it is important to understand the links between human activities and pressures and the evidence behind such links. 

In 2013 JNCC compiled an activities-pressures matrix which identified 39 human use activity categories and 34 human pressure types. In 2015 Defra commissioned a project, led by ABPmer, to develop the evidence base for understanding the relationships between these human activities and pressures within the marine environment.

A database was created to record the outputs of the literature review, including the collated evidence for links between the human activities and sub-activities and the relevant pressures.

Marine Pressures-Activities Database (PAD) v1.3 (2018) is a revised version of the PAD (2015) developed by JNCC using the outputs of the Defra-commissioned contract ME5218 (Defra 2015).
 
JNCC has redeveloped the PAD firstly to re-format and update it to align with Natural England's advice on operations and Marine Scotland/Scottish Natural Heritage's FeAST tools to the extent possible, while still maintaining much of the evidence base collated under project ME5218, and secondly to include additional activities relevant to the offshore that were not included in the 2015 version or the existing tools.

While the key driver for the PAD (2018) update is to support the advice on operations for UK offshore Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), it will also be used for other areas of work including non-MPA projects such as the development of biodiversity indicators for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD).

The overall aim is to provide a UK-level product that can be used for inshore and offshore waters, within or outwith of MPAs.

The PAD can be accessed as an Access database on JNCC's website at http://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-7136 and at data.gov.uk. The zip file also contains Excel copies of the reference list and the activity-pressure relationships (MasterPAD_20181015.xlsx).
